ðŸ“˜ Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning
ðŸ§© Overview

This project focuses on building a Machine Learning model to predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on applicant details such as income, loan amount, employment status, credit score, and other key attributes.
It automates the decision-making process and helps financial institutions improve efficiency and accuracy in loan evaluation.

ðŸ§  Objective

Predict loan approval status using machine learning algorithms.

Analyze key factors influencing loan decisions.


ðŸ“Š Dataset

Dataset Name: Loan Approval Dataset
Features include:

no_of_dependents â€“ Number of dependents

education â€“ Graduate / Not Graduate

self_employed â€“ Employment type

income_annum â€“ Annual income

loan_amount â€“ Requested loan amount

loan_term â€“ Duration of the loan

cibil_score â€“ Applicantâ€™s credit score

assets â€“ Total value of owned assets

loan_status â€“ Target variable (Approved/Rejected)

ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing

Handled missing and infinite values.

Encoded categorical variables.

Checked and removed zero variance features.

Normalized large numeric features using StandardScaler.

Split dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

ðŸ§® Machine Learning Models

The following models were implemented and compared:

Random Forest Classifier (best performing model)

The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy and stability due to its ability to handle feature correlations and reduce overfitting.
